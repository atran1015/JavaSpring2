/* Task 1: Implement an OOD that features:
    A generic Aircraft that has common features
    A Glider with commonalities with Aircraft as well as unique things
    A Jet with commonalities with Aircraft as well as unique things
    A Helicopter with commonalities with Aircraft as well as unique things
    Print instances of the above objects in console
